If love is not worth loving, then life is not worth living,
Nor aught is worth remembering but well forgot;
For store is not worth storing and gifts are not worth giving,
If love is not;

And idly cold is death-cold, and life-heat idly hot,
And vain is any offering and vainer our receiving,
And vanity of vanities is all our lot.

Better than life’s heaving heart is death’s heart unheaving, Better than the opening leaves are the leaves that rot,
For there is nothing left worth achieving or retrieving,
If love is not.
